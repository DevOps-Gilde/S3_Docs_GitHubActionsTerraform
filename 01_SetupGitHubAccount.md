# 1. Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. GitHub has been acquired by Microsoft. In the long run GitHub will replace Azure DevOps.

Due to the new strategic shift they will be in focus for the upcoming two sessions.
