## Activate Workflows
When you fork a repository your workflows with GitHub Actions might not yet be activated. Click on the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.

To run a workflow you first have to select the workflow you want to run at the left-hand side. You get then an additional button to run the workflow as shown below:<br>
